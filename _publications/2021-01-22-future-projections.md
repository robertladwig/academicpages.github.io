collection: publications
permalink: 
excerpt: 'Using data generated by a regionalized climate model (RCM) as input to a simple hydrological model and a one-dimensional vertical hydrodynamic model, we forecast potential changes in the Itupararanga reservoir, São Paulo, Brazil, in an exemplary time period (2028–2030) in the next decade.'
