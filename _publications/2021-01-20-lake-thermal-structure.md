title: "Lake thermal structure drives inter-annual variability in summer anoxia dynamics in a eutrophic lake over 37 years"
collection: publications

excerpt: 'In this study, we used a vertical one-dimensional hydrodynamic-ecological model (GLM-AED2) coupled with a calibrated hydrological catchment model (PIHM-Lake) to simulate the thermal and water quality dynamics of the eutrophic Lake Mendota (USA) over a 37-year period to get a better understanding of inter-annual drivers of summer anoxia.'
