Welcome, my name is Robert. I am a hydrologist with a keen interest in computational limnology.

I am a Postdoc at the [Center for Limnology](https://limnology.wisc.edu/) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison advised by [Hilary Dugan](https://dugan.limnology.wisc.edu/) and [Paul Hanson](http://hanson.limnology.wisc.edu) working on simulating aquatic ecosystems using [GLM-AED2](http://aed.see.uwa.edu.au/research/models/GLM/). My scientific work focuses on the interactions between lake ecosystems and their external drivers (atmosphere, catchment, agriculture, water management) as well as how these processes can be numerically simulated.

I did my PhD work at the [Leibniz-Institute of Freshwater Ecology and Inland Fisheries (IGB)](https://www.igb-berlin.de/en) in Berlin, Germany, supervised by [Michael Hupfer](https://www.igb-berlin.de/en/hupfer) and [Reinhard Hinkelmann](https://www.wahyd.tu-berlin.de/menue/about_us/team/head/prof_dr-ing_reinhard_hinkelmann/). Here, I studied the impact of multiple stressors on urban lakes using field sampling, monitoring and numerical modeling (e.g. GLM-AED2, FLake, open TELEMAC-MASCARET).
