Welcome, my name is Robert. I am a hydrologist with a keen interest in computational limnology.

I am a Postdoc at the [Center for Limnology](https://limnology.wisc.edu/) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison advised by [Hilary Dugan](https://dugan.limnology.wisc.edu/) and [Paul Hanson](http://hanson.limnology.wisc.edu) working on simulating aquatic ecosystems using [GLM-AED2](http://aed.see.uwa.edu.au/research/models/GLM/). A main focus of my research is to develop tools that ease the application of numerical models for first-time users. I am interested in investigating feedback mechanisms between atmospheric drivers, the catchment and in-lake stratification/mixing dynamics. Recently, a focus of my work is on understanding what is driving dissolved oxygen depletion dynamics in lakes.

My current research interests in a nutshell:
- improving aquatic ecosystem models:
  - open source scientific software for running and post-processing numerical models (e.g., [LakeEnsemblR](https://github.com/aemon-j/LakeEnsemblR), [glmtools](https://github.com/USGS-R/glmtools))
  - [knowledge-guided machine learning](https://sites.google.com/umn.edu/kgml/home) to simulate in-lake oxygen dynamics on a large scale
  - integrating stochastic processes into deterministic models, e.g. to improve simulations of phytoplankton bloom dynamics
- applying aquatic ecosystem models:
  - numerical modeling of long-term dissolved oxygen depletion dynamics in lakes (anoxia, metalimnetic oxygen minimum)
  - investigating the impact of climate change on future lake mixing dynamics ([Lake Tegel](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4441/10/2/186))
  - researching how we can improve the management of urban water resources ([PhD thesis](https://depositonce.tu-berlin.de/handle/11303/9203))

I did my PhD work at the [Leibniz-Institute of Freshwater Ecology and Inland Fisheries (IGB)](https://www.igb-berlin.de/en) in Berlin, Germany, supervised by [Michael Hupfer](https://www.igb-berlin.de/en/hupfer) and [Reinhard Hinkelmann](https://www.wahyd.tu-berlin.de/menue/about_us/team/head/prof_dr-ing_reinhard_hinkelmann/). Here, I studied the impact of multiple stressors on urban lakes using field sampling, monitoring and numerical modeling (e.g. vertical 1D GLM-AED2, vertical 1D FLake, depth-averaged 2D open TELEMAC-MASCARET).
