Welcome, my name is Robert. I am a hydrologist with a keen interest in computational limnology and aquatic ecology.

I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the [Center for Limnology](https://limnology.wisc.edu/) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison advised by [Hilary Dugan](https://dugan.limnology.wisc.edu/) and [Paul Hanson](http://hanson.limnology.wisc.edu) working on simulating aquatic ecosystems using [GLM-AED2](http://aed.see.uwa.edu.au/research/models/GLM/). A main focus of my research is to develop tools that ease the application of numerical models for first-time users. I am interested in investigating feedback mechanisms between atmospheric drivers, the catchment and in-lake stratification/mixing dynamics. Recently, a focus of my work is on understanding what is driving dissolved oxygen depletion dynamics in lakes.

# ***Do physical interactions (mixing, morphology) govern water quality, and, if so, are biological drivers only delaying the inevitable?***
My current research interests in a nutshell:
- lake phenology (i.e., stratification and ice dynamics, lake metabolism, phytoplankton blooms):
  - long-term dissolved oxygen depletion dynamics in lakes (anoxia in [Lake Mendota](https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-25-1009-2021), metalimnetic oxygen minimum)
  - investigating the impact of climate change on future lake mixing dynamics ([Lake Tegel](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4441/10/2/186), [Ensemble analysis](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-22657-4))
  - integrating stochastic processes into deterministic models, e.g. to improve simulations of phytoplankton bloom dynamics
- sustainable water resources management (e.g., [Lake Tegel](https://depositonce.tu-berlin.de/handle/11303/9203), [Itupararanga reservoir](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720382747?via%3Dihub))
- aquatic ecosystem modeling:
  - open source scientific software for running and post-processing numerical models (e.g., [LakeEnsemblR](https://github.com/aemon-j/LakeEnsemblR)/[paper](https://eartharxiv.org/repository/view/1960/), [glmtools](https://github.com/USGS-R/glmtools))
  - [knowledge-guided machine learning](https://sites.google.com/umn.edu/kgml/home) to simulate in-lake oxygen/carbon dynamics on a large scale
  

I did my PhD work at the [Leibniz-Institute of Freshwater Ecology and Inland Fisheries (IGB)](https://www.igb-berlin.de/en) in Berlin, Germany, supervised by [Michael Hupfer](https://www.igb-berlin.de/en/hupfer) and [Reinhard Hinkelmann](https://www.wahyd.tu-berlin.de/menue/about_us/team/head/prof_dr-ing_reinhard_hinkelmann/). Here, I studied the impact of multiple stressors on urban lakes using field sampling, monitoring and numerical modeling (e.g. vertical 1D GLM-AED2, vertical 1D FLake, depth-averaged 2D open TELEMAC-MASCARET).
