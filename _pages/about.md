**NEWS! [2018-10-22]** After 1209 days, I have finally submitted my PhD thesis!
{: .notice}

Hi, my name is Robert and I am a hydrologist turned limnologist with a huge interest in numerical modeling of freshwater ecosystems and environmental fluid dynamics. I am a PhD student at the [Leibniz-Institute of Freshwater Ecology and Inland Fisheries (IGB)](https://www.igb-berlin.de/en) in Berlin, Germany, supervised by [Dr. Michael Hupfer](https://www.igb-berlin.de/en/hupfer). Here, I study the impact of multiple stressors on urban lakes using field sampling, monitoring and numerical modeling. Urban lakes are strongly managed systems, which are influenced by a large sealed urban catchment area with multiple sources of diffuse pollutants. By applying different numerical models (GLM-AED2, FLake, open TELEMAC-MASCARET), I have investigated how the urban lake management can adapt to mitigate the impact of stressors on the lake ecosystem. My research was carried out as project T4 of the Research Training Group [“Urban Water Interfaces (UWI)”](https://www.uwi.tu-berlin.de/menue/urban_water_interfaces/) (GRK 2032/1), which is funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG). 

A focus of my work is to produce a fast and reproducible workflow for the application of numerical models by using sensitivity analyses, automatic calibration techniques, multivariate statistical methods for post-processing and pleasant visualization of data. I firmly believe that aquatic ecosystem models are important tools for teaching physical as well as ecological in-lake processes, are crucial to check hypotheses obtained by field data and should be made accessible to every limnologist, the stakeholders as well as the public regardless of computational power and computer science education.
