Welcome, my name is Robert. I am a hydrologist with a keen interest in computational limnology.

I am a Postdoc at the [Center for Limnology](https://limnology.wisc.edu/) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison advised by [Hilary Dugan](https://dugan.limnology.wisc.edu/) and [Paul Hanson](http://hanson.limnology.wisc.edu) working on simulating aquatic ecosystems using [GLM-AED2](http://aed.see.uwa.edu.au/research/models/GLM/). A main focus of my research is to develop tools that ease the application of numerical models for first-time users (an example is the [AEMON-J LakeEnsemblR project](https://github.com/aemon-j/LakeEnsemblR)). I am also interested in investigating feedback mechanisms between atmospheric drivers and in-lake stratification dynamics. In this regard I am currently simulating oxygen depletion dyanmics of lakes in the US Midwest by using a combination of simple numerical models and physics-guided machine learning approaches.

My current research interests in a nutshell:
- developing software tools for running and post-processing numerical models 
- modeling oxygen depletion dynamics in lakes (anoxia, metalimnetic oxygen minimum)
- physics-guided machine learning to simulate lakes on the continental scale
- investigating the impact of climate change on future lake mixing dynamics

I did my PhD work at the [Leibniz-Institute of Freshwater Ecology and Inland Fisheries (IGB)](https://www.igb-berlin.de/en) in Berlin, Germany, supervised by [Michael Hupfer](https://www.igb-berlin.de/en/hupfer) and [Reinhard Hinkelmann](https://www.wahyd.tu-berlin.de/menue/about_us/team/head/prof_dr-ing_reinhard_hinkelmann/). Here, I studied the impact of multiple stressors on urban lakes using field sampling, monitoring and numerical modeling (e.g. vertical 1D GLM-AED2, vertical 1D FLake, depth-averaged 2D open TELEMAC-MASCARET).
