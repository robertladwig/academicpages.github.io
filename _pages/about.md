**[2019-03-01]** Today is my first working day as a Postdoc at the Center for Limnology at University of Wisconsin-Madison! I am so excited to join Hilary Dugan's Lab to develop modelling tools. **[2018-12-10]** I've just came back from the GLEON20 meeting at Rottnest Island in Australia. Wow, what a fantastic experience. I think I've never discussed that much science (and, more important, modelling) during a week before in my life!
**[2018-10-22]** After 1209 days, I have finally submitted my PhD thesis!

Hi, my name is Robert and I am a hydrologist turned limnologist with a huge interest in the numerical modeling of freshwater ecosystems and environmental fluid dynamics. I am a Postdoc at the [Center for Limnology](https://limnology.wisc.edu/) @ University of Wisconsin-Madison in the Lab of [Hilary Dugan](https://dugan.limnology.wisc.edu/). I did my PhD work at the [Leibniz-Institute of Freshwater Ecology and Inland Fisheries (IGB)](https://www.igb-berlin.de/en) in Berlin, Germany, supervised by [Dr. Michael Hupfer](https://www.igb-berlin.de/en/hupfer) and [Prof. Dr.-Ing. Reinhard Hinkelmann](https://www.wahyd.tu-berlin.de/menue/about_us/team/head/prof_dr-ing_reinhard_hinkelmann/). Here, I studied the impact of multiple stressors on urban lakes using field sampling, monitoring and numerical modeling (e.g. GLM-AED2, FLake, open TELEMAC-MASCARET). 

A focus of my work is to produce a fast and reproducible workflow for the application of numerical models by using sensitivity analyses, automatic calibration techniques, multivariate statistical methods for post-processing and pleasant visualization of data. I firmly believe that aquatic ecosystem models are important tools for teaching physical as well as ecological in-lake processes, are crucial to check hypotheses obtained by field data and should be made accessible to every limnologist, the stakeholders as well as the public regardless of computational power and computer science education.
